<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Renal Dialysis Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hemodialysis</li><li>Peritoneal Dialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The renal dialysis equipment market comprises two primary types: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis uses a machine to filter waste from the blood through an artificial kidney, typically performed in clinics or at home. Peritoneal dialysis involves the infusion of a dialysis solution into the abdominal cavity, where the peritoneum acts as a natural filter, allowing waste to be removed. Each method serves patients with kidney failure, offering different approaches to support renal function and enhance quality of life.</p></p>
