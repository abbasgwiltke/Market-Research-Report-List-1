<p><h1>Biological Valve Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Material, By Type, By End-user, By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2025 - 2032</h1></p><p><strong>Biological Valve Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>A biological valve, also known as a tissue valve, is a type of heart valve replacement derived from animal tissues or human donors. It is designed to mimic the functions of natural heart valves and is often used in patients requiring valve replacement due to conditions like stenosis or regurgitation. Biological valves are favored for their biocompatibility and lower incidence of thromboembolic events compared to mechanical valves, making them a suitable option for certain patient populations.</p><p>The Biological Valve Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.3% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to an increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, an aging population, and advancements in surgical techniques and valve design. Innovations in tissue preservation and minimally invasive procedures are driving market expansion, making biological valves more accessible and appealing to both healthcare providers and patients. Moreover, rising awareness regarding the benefits of biological valves over mechanical options is further fueling the market. As healthcare systems increasingly prioritize patient outcomes, the demand for biological valves is poised to rise, paving the way for enhanced technological advancements and improved treatment options in cardiovascular care.</p></p>
